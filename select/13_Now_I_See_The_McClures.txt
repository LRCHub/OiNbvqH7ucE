Born to the darkness I was
Rejected and cut off from hope
I couldn't see His love for me
They said He's not who He seems
Don't get your hopes up for healing
But lies fell away when I saw His face

My heart burst to life
I saw delight in His eyes when He looked at me
My whole world's on fire
Alive in the presence that burns inside of me
Now I know whose I am
Forever I'll stand on Your truth I believe
'Cause I was blind but now I see

Night turned to daylight for me
Joy is the song that I sing
All of my days are filled with Your praise
All of my days are filled with Your praise

My heart burst to life
I saw delight in His eyes when He looked at me
My whole world's on fire
Alive in the presence that burns inside of me
Now I know whose I am
Forever I'll stand on Your truth I believe
'Cause I was blind but now I see

No one could ever take my song away
My eyes were opened and I saw His face
No one could ever take away my faith
My life was changed the day that Jesus came
No one could ever take my song away
My eyes were opened and I saw His face
No one could ever take away my faith
My life was changed the day that Jesus came, came

My heart burst to life
I saw delight in His eyes when He looked at me
My whole world's on fire
Alive in the presence that burns inside of me
Now I know whose I am
Forever I'll stand on Your truth I believe
'Cause I was blind but now I see
Was blind but now I see
