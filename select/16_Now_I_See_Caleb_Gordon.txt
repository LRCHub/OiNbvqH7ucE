2000 E-S-T
I mean, if you don't know where I'm at by now, then
Like, what is you doin'?
Like, look, aye
Yeah, O-C-O-E-E
Yeah, yeah

I tried to tell 'em that it's pressure, uhn
Yeah, I don't gotta smoke the pressure
Open up The Word, learn my lesson, uhn
The Devil on a stretcher, uhn
Hold on, wait, let me check my schedule, uhn
'Cause I ain't got no time to be extra
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the gum, mm, mm
I ain't talkin' 'bout the gum
You ain't talkin' 'bout the Son, then we done
No, you not my honey-bun (uh-uh, uhn)
Just like Joseph, I'ma run
And it's over, I ain't doin' this for fun
No four-leaf clover
I don't play the luck, no, I don't do the puns
See, we do it for Jehovah, we ain't doin' it for fun
Used to shoot the J, from A to Z, uh, shout out B
My life got hazy on a make-belief
But now I see

I'm doin' stranger things, they can't believe
In what they see, we movin' mountains just like Hercules
But not 'cause of me, it's 'cause the Spirit that's inside of me
He made everything, I told 'em only way to know yourself
Is to know the King, I told 'em only way to grow yourself
Be planted like a tree, by that river of living water
Let it flow inside of me, so we flow just like the sea
I ain't talkin' Socrates when we talk philosophy
If you don't read the logic, how you gon' start thinkin' logically?
How you gon' get the knowledge?
You don't read it chronologically
He believe in order, everyday, He did a different thing
And just like a reporter here, we quick to pull up on the scene
And I'm a livin' witness, catch me on the TV witnessing
Uhn, witnessing, uhn
They used to catch me on the TV witnessing
I read The Word and I take notes, just like I sing (uhn)
I'm like, "We chillin' in the boat, even if we sink"

I'm like, "What you complainin' 'bout?!"
"'Cause everyday, you blink"
I'm like, "Wait, what you complainin' 'bout?!"
"Some people can't e'en think!"
I'm like, "Hold on, hold on, wait, what you complainin' 'bout?!"
"'Cause everyday, you drink!"
And you gon' go 'head get mad 'bout washin' dishes in the sink!
Like, wait, like, I know some homeless people, ain't got no place
Um, wait, I don't wanna see no frown, smile on your face!
Yeah, yeah, even if we get down, back up in my place
Aw, nah, I can't never stay down, 'cause I know I got grace! Uh
I can't never stay down, 'cause I know I got grace
Uhn, uhn, everybody want cake, but they don't want Easy Bake
Uh, look
So I stay firm on faith and let Him lead the way
I said, um, I stay firm on faith--
Yeah

I tried to tell 'em that it's pressure, uhn
Yeah, I don't gotta smoke the pressure
Open up The Word, learn my lesson, uhn
The Devil on a stretcher, uhn
Hold on, wait, let me check my schedule, uhn
'Cause I ain't got no time to be extra
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the gum, mm, mm
I ain't talkin' 'bout the gum
You ain't talkin' 'bout the Son, then we done
No, you not my honey-bun (uh-uh, uhn)
Just like Joseph, I'ma run
And it's over, I ain't doin' this for fun
No four-leaf clover
I don't play the luck, no, I don't do the puns
See, we do it for Jehovah, we ain't doin' it for fun
Used to shoot the J, from A to Z, uh, shout out B
My life got hazy on a make-belief
