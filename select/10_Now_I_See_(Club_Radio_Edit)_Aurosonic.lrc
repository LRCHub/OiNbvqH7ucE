[00:41.90] I let you keep the key
[00:46.91] A prisoner in love
[00:51.42] I didn't want to go
[00:54.53] unless you came with me
[01:06.03] 
[00:58.69] i was blinded
[01:02.78] And i am so ashamed
[01:06.77] That it took so lang for me to break away
[01:27.27] 
[01:12.15] Now i see, who you are
[01:19.40] I can only be pushed so far
[01:26.63] Now I see, Now I see
[01:34.34] That you were never good for me
