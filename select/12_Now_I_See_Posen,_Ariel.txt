Whatever you got
Whatever you need
All the little things you wanna believe
There is a feeling
A feeling so free
Leaving it all to die
Breaking the ties that bind

Now I see
It's all left behind me
I can't turn around
Now I see
The road unwinding
Time's slowing down
I just wanna be

Somebody honest
Someone so wise
Someone who always takes the time
Somebody better
Better than me
Though I should try harder
Not to be so hard on everything
I just need to breathe

Now I see
It's all left behind me
I can't turn around
Now I see
The road unwinding
Time's slowing down
I just wanna be

Now I see
It's all left behind me
I can't turn around
Now I see
The road unwinding
Time's slowing down
Time's just slowing down
Time's just slowing down
Time's just slowing down
